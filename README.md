# Pacman Line Following Robot

## Description

In this project, we were tasked with developing a robot to traverse a map, plan suitable paths and travel at a fixed speed. There is a limited similarity to the classic game Pacman. The maze and the food pellets were projected vertically down (from a ceiling mounted projector). The robot will gobble up the pellets when it makes contact with the pellet. The robot is multi-wheeled and incorporates an on-board microcontroller to control the movement of the robot. We designed, assembled and tested a light sensor circuit which was interfaced to the provided microcontroller. The light sensing circuits was implemented using printed circuit boards (PCBs) by going through the typical process: analysis, schematic capture, artwork design, circuit assembly and final testing. The robot was powered by an on-board energy storage system: re-chargable batteries.
