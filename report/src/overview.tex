\section{Abstract}
This report covers the analogue and digital design of our line following robot. The overall project helped us develop core computer systems engineering skills that are commonly utilised in the Research and Development field. There were many design decisions made throughout this project which are documented in detail. In this report you will find analysis of our design decisions, commentary of our design process and information of the final product.

\section{Introduction}
In this project, we are tasked with developing a robot that would traverse a projected map and collect all the available food pellets, akin to that of the 80s classic, PacMan. There were two major components to this project; the analogue design and digital design. For the analogue design, data inputs from the environment needs to be processed into a useful form. On the other hand, the design aspect required us to utilise the outputs of the analogue circuit and develop effective algorithms to navigate the map under different scenarios.
