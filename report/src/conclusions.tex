\section{Conclusion}
For this project, we were tasked with designing the analogue and digital aspects of a line following robot. The analogue design required us to interpret the lights projected by the maze and process it into a useful form for the robot. The digital aspect requires us to utilise our light sensing circuits to synchronise the robot’s position with the path finding algorithm and control our motors. With many approaches available, it was up to our team to consider the best solution to implement. Due to this, we have developed skills that are vital to our professional career throughout this project. This project allowed us to explore many aspects of Research \& Development through electronic and software development, which further developed our core engineering skills. Our team dynamic was key to the success of this project as we were able to utilise everyone’s strengths and weaknesses, to produce a final product that we are satisfied with.
